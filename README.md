Using pointers in c++ to hadle soting an array

In the example shown, I intend to use pointers and dereferencing to sort the array. "Im still learning this though".

Here I use *(arr) and *(arr + 1) for dereferencing the elements contained in the array.

*(arr) dereferences the first element in the array getting its value and *(arr + 1) dereferences the value stored in the second address.
